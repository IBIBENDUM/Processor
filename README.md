The project includes an Assembler and a Software Processing Unit (CPU)

Assembler compiles a program written by the user. If the program contains errors, the assembler will tell the user where the errors were found. In case of successful compilation, the output will be a listing file and a file with a bytecode.

SPU executes commands from a file generated by the assembler. The data is stored in the stack and RAM.

## Assembler
Syntax example
~~~
    push 5
    push 1
    sub
    out; print 5-1 = 4
    HLT
~~~

Processor supports 19 commands

In the table below ---, --I, and so on are possible combinations of arguments.

| --- | --I | -RI | -R- | M-I | MR- | MRI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

 So `push` command supporting the `MRI` combination will accept all three arguments, for example `push [rax + 5]`

### Basic commands
| NAME | CODE | --- | --I | -RI | -R- | M-I | MR- | MRI |           DESCRIPTION            |
|:----:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:--------------------------------:|
| push |  1   |  -  |  +  |  +  |  +  |  +  |  +  |  +  |       push value to stack        |
| pop  |  2   |  +  |  -  |  -  |  +  |  +  |  +  |  +  |       pop value from stack       |
| out  |  14  |  +  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  | print last stack value to stdout |
|  in  |  13  |  +  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  push value to stack from stdin  |
| HLT  |  12  |  +  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |     terminate program (halt)     |
| dump |  15  |  +  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |       print VRAM to stdout       |

### Jumps
`jmp` command jumps by the command number, for example
```
jmp 16; jump on the team with the number 16
jmp label; jump to the command that label points to
```

Conditional jumps are available, they will be executed under a certain condition, for example:
```
push 4
push 4
je mark; jump will be executed since the last two values in the stack are equal
~~~
push 4
push 3
jb mark; jump will not be executed since 4 > 3
```

[!IMPORTANT]
Conditional jumps take the last two values from the stack and do not return them back

`call` works on the same principle, except that the current position is put on the stack before jumping. After the end of the method, you can jump back using the `ret` command

[!IMPORTANT]
`ret` will return us to the right place, the last value of the stack should be the same number that the `call` command put

All jumps support these combinations of arguments: --I, -R-, M-I, MR-, MRI

| NAME | CODE |     DESCRIPTION      |
|:----:|:----:|:--------------------:|
| jmp  |  4   |     default jump     |
| call |  5   |  jump to the method  |
| ret  |  6   | jump from the method |
|  ja  |  7   |      jump if >       |
| jae  |  8   |      jump if >=      |
|  jb  |  9   |      jump if <       |
| jbe  |  10  |      jump if <=      |
|  je  |  11  |      jump if ==      |

You can pass values to the method using registers or using RAM
```
push 4
pop rax
call method; if you write `push rax` in the method, 4 will be put on the stack
~~~
push 4
pop [5]
call method; if you write `push [5]` in the method, 4 will be put on the
```

### Math
| NAME | CODE | DESCRIPTION |
|:----:|:----:|:-----------:|
| sqrt |  3   | square root |
| add  |  16  |     add     |
| sub  |  17  |  subtract   |
| mul  |  18  |  multiply   |
| div  |  19  |   divide    |
The division-by-zero behavior is undefined, just like in C

## How to use
### Assembler
- `-h` Print help information in console
- `-i` Select input file
- `-o` Select output file
-  `-l` Select a file for listing
- `-m` Select the level of log messages

To compile the quadratic_solver example, type this into console
```
asm -i ../Examples/Text/quadratic_solver.s  -o ../Examples/Binaries/quadratic_solver.asm -m ERROR
```
### SPU
- `-h` Print help information in console
- `-i` Select input file
- `-o` Select output file
- `-m` Select the level of log messages
To compile the quadratic_solver example, type this into console
```
spu -i ../Examples/Binaries/quadratic_solver.asm -m ERROR
```

## Examples
- quadratic_solver quadratic equation solver
- factorial_calc factorial calculator
- draw_circle draw a circle

## Build
In the Assembler folder, type `make` into the console
In the CPU folder, type `make` into the console
